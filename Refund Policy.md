## Providers
We use two different product suppliers in order to provide our products: Printful, and Printify. These providers may have different Return Policies, and thus have different requirements for returns. Please contact us using the details above if you believe your return meets our requirements.

# Printful
Any claims for misprinted/damaged/defective items must be submitted within 4 weeks after the product has been received. For packages lost in transit, all claims must be submitted no later than 4 weeks after the estimated delivery date. Claims deemed an error on our part are covered at our expense.

If you notice an issue on the products or anything else on the order, provide the details to the contact methods listed above.

Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received your returned item. We will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.

If you are approved, then your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of payment, within a certain amount of days.

## Late or missing refunds

If you haven’t received a refund yet:
 1. Check your bank account again
 2. Contact your credit card company, it may take some time before your refund is officially posted.
 3. Contact your bank. There is often some processing time before a refund is posted.

If you’ve done all of this and you still have not received your refund yet, please contact us using the details listed above.

# Printify
