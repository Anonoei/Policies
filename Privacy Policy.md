This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or make a purchase from https://anonoei.com (the “Site”).​

This Policy shall be governed and interpreted in accordance with the English language, regardless of any translations made for any purpose whatsoever.

## Who we are

Anonoei, a subsidiary and individual working under DAAV, LLC provides various services, including but not limited to the website https://anonoei.com. If you need to contact me directly, please email contact@anonoei.com, or use my [contact form](htttps://anonoei.com/contact).

## Personal information we may collect, and why we collect it

When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, and time zone. 

We refer to this automatically-collected information as "Device Information". We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address).

We may collect Device Information using the following technologies:
 - "Cookies" are data files placed on your device on computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable them, visit https://allaboutcookies.org
 - "Log files" track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet Service Provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps
 - "Web beacons" and "tags" are electronic files used to record information about how you browse the Site.

### The store

Additionally, when you make a purchase or attempt to make a purchase through the Site, we collect certain information from you, including your name, billing address, shipping address, payment information (including credit card numbers or other payment identifiers), email address, and phone number. We refer to this information as "Order Information".

When we reference "Personal Information" in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information and Order Information.

When you purchase from us, we’ll ask you to provide Order Information and optional account information like username and password. We’ll use this information for purposes, such as, to:

 - Send you information about your account and order
 - Respond to your requests, including refunds and complaints
 - Process payments and prevent fraud
 - Set up your account for our store
 - Comply with any legal obligations we have, such as calculating taxes
 - Improve our store offerings
 - Send you marketing messages, if you choose to receive them

### Accounts

If you create an account, we will store your name, address, email, and phone number, which will be used to populate the store checkout for future orders. We also store your username and password to ensure you can log in to your account. We generally store this information about you for as long as we need the information for the purposes for which we collect and use it, and we are not legally required to continue to keep it. For example, we will store order information indefinitely for tax and accounting purposes. This includes your Order Information.

### Activity

This site records certain user actions, in the form of "activity data". Activity data includes updates and comments posted directly to activity streams, as well as descriptions of other actions performed while using the site, such as new friendships, newly joined groups, and profile updates.

The content of activity data items obey the same privacy rules as the contexts in which the activity items are created. For example, activity updates created in a user's profile is publicly visible, while activity items generated in a private group are visible only to members of that group.

Activity items may be deleted at any time by users who created them.

### Messages

The content of private messages is visible only to the sender and the recipients of the message. With the exception of site administrators, who can read all private messages, private message content is never visible to other users or site visitors.

We will also store commends or reviews, if you choose to leave them.

### Comments

When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.

An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

### Media

If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.

### Cookies

If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.

If you visit our login page, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.

When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select “Remember Me”, your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.

If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie includes no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after 1 day.

We use a cookie to show success and failure messages to logged-in users, in response to certain actions, like joining a group. These cookies contain no personal data, and are deleted immediately after the next page load.

We use cookies on group, member, and activity directories to keep track of a user's browsing preferences. These preferences include the last-selected values of the sort and filter dropdowns, as well as pagination information. These cookies contain no personal data, and are deleted after 24 hours.

When a logged-in user creates a new group, we use a number of cookies to keep track of the group creation process. These cookies contain no personal data, and are deleted either upon the successful creation of the group or after 24 hours.

## Who has access

Members of our team have access to the information you provide us. For example, both Administrators and Shop Managers can access:
 - Order information like what was purchased, when it was purchased and where it should be sent, and
 - Customer information like your name, email address, and billing and shipping information.

Additionally, Administrators can:
 - access and delete the content of any message
 - view and edit all activity items, regardless of context

Our team members have access to this information to help fulfill orders, process refunds and support you.

## Data retention

When you place an order through the Site, we will maintain your Order Information for our records unless and until you ask us to delete this information. We are unable to delete the total cost of your order for financial and legal reasons.

If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.

For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.

## Your rights

If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes. If you would like to exercise your right to access your personal information, please contact us through the contact information below. Additionally, please note we are processing your information in order to fulfill contracts we might have with you (for example: if you make an order through the Site), or otherwise to pursue our legitimate business interests listed above and that your information will be transferred to regions such as Canada and the United States.

## Where we send your data

Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.

## Embedded content from other websites

Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

### Sharing your personal information

We may share your Personal Information with third parties to help us use your Personal Information, as described above. For example, we use services such as Printful to power our online store – you can read more about how Printful uses your Personal Information here: https://www.printful.com/policies/privacy.

When using our store, We share information with third parties who help us provide our orders and store services to you; for example — We accept payments through PayPal. When processing payments, some of your data will be passed to PayPal, including information required to process or support the payment, such as the purchase total and billing information. Please see the PayPal Privacy Policy for more details.

Finally, we may also share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.

### Minors

The Site is not intended for individuals under the age of 13, and/or the minimum age for your country or region.
